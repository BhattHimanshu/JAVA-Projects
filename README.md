# About Project
This is a original Fish Acquarium Project which is a proof to my comfort and handeling ,a multithreaded
aquarium where the fish actually swim around and bounce
off the walls. i have create a dozen fish objects and
turn them loose in the aquarium, where they're going to do
their own thing as you'd expect fish to do.

Each Fish is an Individual Object which Randomly Decide its own location and Ve;locity and are inbound with the walls of Acquarium ,
When they hit the wall they change their Direction .
